# Basic neural network mnist - Keras
Very basic classification of handwritten images using keras neural network

This basic project takes the MNIST dataset containing 28x28px handwritten images and classifies them into their respective classes. Rather than Conv2D layers, it uses Dense layers and was the very first neural network I created. This network achieved an accuracy of  97.86%. I have since completed a far more sophisticated version of this project and uploaded it to kaggle.
